= Excel export for Situation Expression Tables =

Situation Expression Tables can be exported to Excel by selecting ''Export Expression Table'' from the table's context menu.
The export will create a timestamped excel file in the project root folder containing a representation of the expression table, where rows that represent State Machines are mapped to columns and Situations are mapped to one or more connected rows, e.g:

[[Image: excel_example0.png]]

is transformed into the following Excel table:

[[Image: excel_example1.png]]

Expressions in a single row are connected via AND for every column, e.g. the first row is read:

State 1 (of LC1/StateMachine 1) AND State 1 (of LC2/StateMachine 1).
AND Expressions over States in a Single State Machine are displayed as a comma separated list of States in a single cell, e.g. ''State2, NOT State 1'' is read as ''State2 AND NOT State 1''.

A Situation can span more than one row, and in that case, the rows are connected by boolean OR.
