		<h1 id="Excel_export_for_Situation_Expression_Tables">Excel export for Situation Expression Tables</h1>
		<p>Situation Expression Tables can be exported to Excel by selecting 
			<i>Export Expression Table</i> from the table's context menu.
			The export will create a timestamped excel file in the project root folder containing a representation of the expression table, where rows that represent State Machines are mapped to columns and Situations are mapped to one or more connected rows, e.g:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="excel_example0.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>is transformed into the following Excel table:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="excel_example1.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Expressions in a single row are connected via AND for every column, e.g. the first row is read:</p>
		<p>State 1 (of LC1/StateMachine 1) AND State 1 (of LC2/StateMachine 1).
			AND Expressions over States in a Single State Machine are displayed as a comma separated list of States in a single cell, e.g. 
			<i>State2, NOT State 1</i> is read as 
			<i>State2 AND NOT State 1</i>.
		</p>
		<p>A Situation can span more than one row, and in that case, the rows are connected by boolean OR.</p>
