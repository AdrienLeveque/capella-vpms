# Test fixture format: Each fixture is 4 lines followed by a line of whitespace.
# Line 1: Input
# Line 2: Expected roundtrip output (Needed because the parser/unparse does not conserve record unnecessary parentheses
# Line 3: Expected NNF
# Line 4: Expected DNF
# If a line is a -, it means "same as the previous line"
