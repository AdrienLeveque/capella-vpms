= Working with Configurations =

The Modes and States viewpoint adds the concept of a ''Configuration''. A Configuration is associated to a ''Component'' or a ''ComponentPkg''. The ''Scope'' of a Configuration denotes the set of model elements that the Configuration
can either ''exclude'' or ''include''. It encompasses:

* The ''Components'' and ''Deployed Components'' of the Configuration's owner, recursively.
* The ''Component Ports'' and ''Physical Ports'' of all Components in the Scope.
* The ''Component Exchanges'' and ''Physical Links'' whose source and target port are in the Scope.
* The allocated ''Functions'' of all Components in the Scope.
* The ''Function Ports'' of all Functions in the Scope.
* The ''Functional Exchanges'' whose source and target port are in the Scope.
* The ''Scenarios'' with at least one InstanceRole targeting a Component or Function that is in the Scope.
* The ''Functional Chains'' involving at least one Function that is in the Scope.

Configurations can be seen in the Project Explorer under the Component or Component package under which they are defined.

== Configuration Element table ==
The easiest way to edit configurations for a component is by using the crosstable diagram ''Configuration Elements'', which can be created on ''Component'' and ''ComponentPkg'' elements. The table will show all Configurations 
directly owned by that Component/Component Package as columns, and the scope elements of these Configurations as rows. (Because the scope of a Configuration depends solely on its location in the model tree, and all shown Configurations have the same location, they all have the same scope).

Elements that are excluded from a Configuration show 'E', elements that are included show 'I' and elements that are neither, have empty cell values. 

To exclude an element from a Configuration, enter 'e' or 'E' in the corresponding table cell.
To include an element from a Configuration, enter 'i' or 'I' in the corresponding table cell.
To neither include/exclude an element from a Configuration, clear the table cell.

A quick way to include/exclude all elements that are not yet neither included nor excluded is via the
context menu Actions ''Include remaining elements'' / ''Exclude remaining elements'', which are available
when a Configuration is selected either in a Diagram, the Capella Project Explorer or by highlighting any
table cell in a Configuration Elements table:

It is possible to hide/show elements by type by toggling element types via the table's context menu ''Show/Hide->Filter Lines by Class'':

= 'Configurations' Diagram Extension Layer =

The viewpoint contributes a diagram extension layer named 'Configurations' to the following Capella Diagram Types:

* Operational Architecture Blank
* System Architecture Blank
* Logical Architecture Blank
* Physical Architecture Blank
* Contextual Component External Interfaces
* Contextual Component Detailed Interfaces
* Operational Activity Interaction Blank
* Logical Data Flow Blank
* System Data Flow Blank
* Physical Data Flow Blank
* Exchange Scenario
* Interface Scenario

To activate the layer on one of the supported diagrams select 'Configurations' from the Diagram Layer dropdown menu:

[[Image:layer.png]]

When the layer is active, the tool palette will show a tool group ''Configurations'':

The ''Configuration'' tool allows to create new Configuration model elements. It can be applied on the diagram canvas or any of the components shown on the diagram.

The ''Configuration Selection'' tool allows to show existing Configuration model elements on the diagram. It can be applied on the diagram canvas or any of the components shown on the diagram.

A configuration may define a set of child configurations. When such a configuration is active, all of its child configurations are active too. The possible set of child configurations is limited to the configurations defined in subcomponents of the configurations own component.

Establish child relations by using the ''Add child configuration'' edge tool:

[[Image:example17.png]]

In xAB diagrams, child configuration relationships visibility can be toggled by using the ''Child Configuration Edges'' tool anywhere in a Diagram:

[[Image:child_configurations_toggle.png]]



To remove a relationship, simple delete the relationship edge in the diagram.

== Layer Visuals ==

When a Configuration is shown on a diagram, elements that are ''included'' in the Configuration have their standard color. Elements that are ''excluded'' are shown in red, elements that are neither ''excluded'' nor ''included'' are greyed out. Elements that are ''included'' in one, but ''excluded'' in a different Configuration are shown in yellow.


= Mode and Configuration =

''Mode and Configuration'' tables can be used to edit the ''supportedModes'' reference of Configurations:

[[Image: mode_and_configuration.png]]

A ''Mode and Configuration'' table can be created on a Component. All Configurations owned by that Component are displayed as columns, all of the owned States/Modes of the Component are shown as rows. If a Configuration is available in a given mode, an 'X' shows in the corresponding table cell. 


Edit a cell by either entering 'x' or 'X' to add a Mode to the supportedModes reference of a Configuration, or clear the cell to remove it.
