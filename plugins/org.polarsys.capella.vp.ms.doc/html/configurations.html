		<h1 id="Working_with_Configurations">Working with Configurations</h1>
		<p>The Modes and States viewpoint adds the concept of a 
			<i>Configuration</i>. A Configuration is associated to a 
			<i>Component</i> or a 
			<i>ComponentPkg</i>. The 
			<i>Scope</i> of a Configuration denotes the set of model elements that the Configuration
			can either 
			<i>exclude</i> or 
			<i>include</i>. It encompasses:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The 
				<i>Components</i> and 
				<i>Deployed Components</i> of the Configuration's owner, recursively.
			</li>
			<li>The 
				<i>Component Ports</i> and 
				<i>Physical Ports</i> of all Components in the Scope.
			</li>
			<li>The 
				<i>Component Exchanges</i> and 
				<i>Physical Links</i> whose source and target port are in the Scope.
			</li>
			<li>The allocated 
				<i>Functions</i> of all Components in the Scope.
			</li>
			<li>The 
				<i>Function Ports</i> of all Functions in the Scope.
			</li>
			<li>The 
				<i>Functional Exchanges</i> whose source and target port are in the Scope.
			</li>
			<li>The 
				<i>Scenarios</i> with at least one InstanceRole targeting a Component or Function that is in the Scope.
			</li>
			<li>The 
				<i>Functional Chains</i> involving at least one Function that is in the Scope.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Configurations can be seen in the Project Explorer under the Component or Component package under which they are defined.</p>
		<p>

		<h2 id="Configuration_Element_table">Configuration Element table</h2>
		<p>The easiest way to edit configurations for a component is by using the crosstable diagram 
			<i>Configuration Elements</i>, which can be created on 
			<i>Component</i> and 
			<i>ComponentPkg</i> elements. The table will show all Configurations 
			directly owned by that Component/Component Package as columns, and the scope elements of these Configurations as rows. (Because the scope of a Configuration depends solely on its location in the model tree, and all shown Configurations have the same location, they all have the same scope).
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="configuration_elements.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Elements that are excluded from a Configuration show 'E', elements that are included show 'I' and elements that are neither, have empty cell values. </p>
		<p>To exclude an element from a Configuration, enter 'e' or 'E' in the corresponding table cell.
			To include an element from a Configuration, enter 'i' or 'I' in the corresponding table cell.
			To neither include/exclude an element from a Configuration, clear the table cell.</p>
		<p>A quick way to include/exclude all elements that are not yet neither included nor excluded is via the
			context menu Actions 
			<i>Include remaining elements</i> / 
			<i>Exclude remaining elements</i>, which are available
			when a Configuration is selected either in a Diagram, the Capella Project Explorer or by highlighting any
			table cell in a Configuration Elements table:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="exclude_remaining.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>It is possible to hide/show elements by type by toggling element types via the table's context menu 
			<i>Show/Hide-&gt;Filter Lines by Class</i>:

		<h1 id=".27Configurations.27_Diagram_Extension_Layer">'Configurations' Diagram Extension Layer</h1>
		<p>The viewpoint contributes a diagram extension layer named 'Configurations' to the following Capella Diagram Types:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Operational Architecture Blank</li>
			<li>System Architecture Blank</li>
			<li>Logical Architecture Blank</li>
			<li>Physical Architecture Blank</li>
			<li>Contextual Component External Interfaces</li>
			<li>Contextual Component Detailed Interfaces</li>
			<li>Operational Activity Interaction Blank</li>
			<li>Logical Data Flow Blank</li>
			<li>System Data Flow Blank</li>
			<li>Physical Data Flow Blank</li>
			<li>Exchange Scenario</li>
			<li>Interface Scenario</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To activate the layer on one of the supported diagrams select 'Configurations' from the Diagram Layer dropdown menu:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="layer.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>When the layer is active, the tool palette will show a tool group 
			<i>Configurations</i>:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="palette.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<i>Configuration</i> tool allows to create new Configuration model elements. It can be applied on the diagram canvas or any of the components shown on the diagram.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<i>Configuration Selection</i> tool allows to show existing Configuration model elements on the diagram. It can be applied on the diagram canvas or any of the components shown on the diagram.
		</p>
		<p>A configuration may define a set of child configurations. When such a configuration is active, all of its child configurations are active too. The possible set of child configurations is limited to the configurations defined in subcomponents of the configurations own component.</p>
		<p>Establish child relations by using the 
			<i>Add child configuration</i> edge tool:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="example17.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>In xAB diagrams, child configuration relationships visibility can be toggled by using the 
			<i>Child Configuration Edges</i> tool anywhere in a Diagram:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="child_configurations_toggle.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>To remove a relationship, simple delete the relationship edge in the diagram.</p>
		<h2 id="Layer_Visuals">Layer Visuals</h2>
		<p>When a Configuration is shown on a diagram, elements that are 
			<i>included</i> in the Configuration have their standard color. Elements that are 
			<i>excluded</i> are shown in red, elements that are neither 
			<i>excluded</i> nor 
			<i>included</i> are greyed out. Elements that are 
			<i>included</i> in one, but 
			<i>excluded</i> in a different Configuration are shown in yellow.
		</p>
		<h1 id="Mode_and_Configuration">Mode and Configuration</h1>
		<p>
			<i>Mode and Configuration</i> tables can be used to edit the 
			<i>supportedModes</i> reference of Configurations:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="mode_and_configuration.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>A 
			<i>Mode and Configuration</i> table can be created on a Component. All Configurations owned by that Component are displayed as columns, all of the owned States/Modes of the Component are shown as rows. If a Configuration is available in a given mode, an 'X' shows in the corresponding table cell. 
		</p>
		<p>Edit a cell by either entering 'x' or 'X' to add a Mode to the supportedModes reference of a Configuration, or clear the cell to remove it.</p>
