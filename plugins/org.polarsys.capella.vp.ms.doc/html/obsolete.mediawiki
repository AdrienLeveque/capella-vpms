== Configuration Access ==

''' Note: As of today, it is not advised to modify the configuration access which is by default "Full" '''

During the development, it was discussed which elements a configuration may include or not. The prototype supports three different options called “Configuration Access”. The three modes will be explained with the help of the following sample model. Configuration 1 is an empty configuration:

'''Flat''': In this mode, a configuration may not include elements of subcomponents. Only its allocated functions, deployed/child components its owned ports and related functional chains may be included.
For the example, the only allowed Elements for Configuration 1 would be "Child" and "Deployed".

'''Subcomponents'''. In this mode, a configuration may additionally include elements of its child components, but not elements of deployed components.
For the example, the allowed additional elements for Configuration 1 would be the Physical Port on "Child".

'''Full'''  In this mode, a configuration may additionally include elements of deployed components. This is the current default mode. 
For the example, the allowed additional elements would be the Physical Function, its port, and the component port on the deployed component.

The default access mode for new Configuration elements can be changed in the Capella Modes and States Preferences:
