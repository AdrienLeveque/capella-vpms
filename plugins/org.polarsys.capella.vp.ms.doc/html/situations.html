		<h1 id="Working_with_Situations">Working with Situations</h1>
		<p>A Situation is defined by a predicate over States of the System, e.g. Situation A is implied by System Component 1 in State B AND System Component 2 in State C or D. Situations and their associated predicate
			can be created under Components:</p>

		<h1 id="Situation_Expressions">Situation Expressions</h1>
		<p>
			<i>Situation Expression</i> tables allow to textually edit the boolean expression of Situations: 
		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Situation Expression</i> tables can be created on Components. The columns of the table are the Situations owned by that component or its subcomponent. The rows of the table are the states/modes of the Component and its subcomponents.
		</p>
		<p>The cells in this table cannot be edited directly, but via the cell's context menu: 
			<i>Change Expression..</i>. This will open a dialog where boolean expressions can be entered. The literals of the expression are entered by pressing Ctrl+Space, and selecting a State. The proposed States/Modes are the States of the Statemachine of the cell's row. The recognised keywords are 
			<i>AND</i>, 
			<i>OR</i>, 
			<i>NOT</i>. Use parentheses '(' and ')' to override operator precedence:

		</p>
		<p>The complete expression for a Situation is then the combined AND of the subexpressions of each row:</p>

		<p>Situations with expressions that do not adhere to this syntactic subset of expressions  will not be shown in the table.</p>
